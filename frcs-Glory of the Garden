This garden contains more than it seems.
so first things first straight away download that file
it is a jpg file
now we dont have any flag in that image 
so i got back and checked the hint to proceed further 
the hint says- What is a hex editor?
so as soon as i saw this i got that it has something to do with the hex editor 
so in my case i used an online hex editor-https://hexed.it/
for inspection i was scrolling through the data and in the end of the data on the RHS i found our required flag
im my case it was- picoCTF{more_than_m33ts_the_3y33dd2eEF5}
