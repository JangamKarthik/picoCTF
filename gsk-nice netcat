net cat is used for connecting our webshell to a address via a port
so to use netcat the following command and the format is used
nc address portnumber
so in my case it was given as
nc mercury.picoctf.net 22902
so directly copy this and
type- nc mercury.picoctf.net 22902             //on webshell
now this results in connecting you with the given address then some random numbers get printed on your screen
then i thought that these numbers might be ascii values so i went to this website for converting ascii values into normal text- https://codebeautify.org/ascii-to-text
now i just copy pasted the data and i got the flag in my case it was
picoCTF{g00d_k1tty!_n1c3_k1tty!_d3dfd6df}
