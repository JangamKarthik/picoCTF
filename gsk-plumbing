// Sometimes you need to handle process data outside of a file. Can you find a way to keep the output from this program and search for the flag? Connect to jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 4427.
here they have given an address and a port to connect so for doing the given task i used netcat command
type- nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 4427
you have some random text on your webshell now after connecting 
now we need to filter out the text and get our flag so i will use grep command to filter out this 
but the challenge here is we donot have a file to use grep still we can use this grep commad to get the job done but to pass the argument we need to use the following format 
since we are grepping the connection so 
type- nc jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 4427|grep pico             //since our flag starts with pico 
this will give us our required flag
picoCTF{digital_plumb3r_5ea1fbd7}
