If I told you a word started with 0x70 in hexadecimal, what would it start with in ASCII?
so given is a hexadecimal number so convert that into a decimal first
i used this site for converting - https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html
and the number is 112 
now we need the 112 ascii that is lowercase p
so our required flag would be
picoCTF{p}
