so first copy the link address by right clicking on static?
now you have the link to the file and you have to download it so use the command wget
type- wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/ff4e569d6b49b92d090796d4631a2577/static
this will download the file and save it in the current directory and the file name in my case was static.1
now we need to view the contents of the file so i will use the strings command to print all of it
type- strings static.1
now some random text will appear on the screen so in order to get our flag we need to search for our flag so i will be using grep command for doing that task
type- strings static.1|grep -i pico
and with this i got the flag in my case it was
picoCTF{d15a5m_t34s3r_ccb2b43e}
