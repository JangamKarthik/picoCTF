lets get started by downloading the given file
now after downloading try to open the file, it doesn't open 
so atfirst i thought it should a hexdump file so i tried opening it on a hex editor and my guess was correct it was a hex file
so for editing at stuff for a hexdump file i used this site- https://hexed.it/
here i took a look at the file content there i found that it was a bitmap file coz it was written BM over there
so i changed the extention of the file to .bmp
now the problem is it is not in the actual bmp format if you carefully observe there is BA D0 written over to place to fix this issue
I took an actual bmp file and modified my current one with it
I had to change 36 00 and 28 00
then i saved the file and opened it
it says it is not a flag sorry.
and if we carefully see the image it looks like it is not the complete image
and it was cropped 
so i ran exiftool on this bmp file to find the properties and check its height and width
type- exiftool tunn3l_v1s10n.bmp
this gave me my bmp files height and width now what i did was i just tried to resize this images height and get the actual image
we need python for this so 
type- python
now type- hex(1134)               //this is because it was the height of the image it was figured out after running exiftool on the file
after running this command i got 0x46e   this indicates the panel which is responsible for the height
now i tried resizing it was a trail and error and i finally got the perfect height which was 850
so now type the following command
type- hex(850)
this resulted in giving me the required height '0x352' now replace it with the original height tile 
!!!! always remember to write the 0x352 in the revere order
now save the edit and view the file once again
boom we got our flag in my case it was
picoCTF{qu1t3_a_v13w_2020}
