The one time pad can be cryptographically secure, but not when you know the key. Can you solve this? We've given you the encrypted flag, key, and a table to help UFJKXQZQUNB with the key of SOLVECRYPTO. Can you use this table to solve it?.
now using wget i downloaded the table  file
then i opened it using strings command
type- wget https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/1fd21547c154c678d2dab145c29f1d79/table.txt
type- strings table.txt.1
now i saw a weird table on my screen then i tried google for table cipher 
then i got to know that this is known as Vigenere cipher 
now this can be easily decoded using -https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/         and select the Vigenere decode option
now we have our dataa to be decoded and a key now enter them and we get- CRYPTOISFUN
so our required flag will be
picoCTF{CRYPTOISFUN}
