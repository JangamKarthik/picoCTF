// What does this bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1 mean? I think it has something to do with bases.
here we have a data that makes no sense -bDNhcm5fdGgzX3IwcDM1 probably its because it is encrypted 
so in order tho decrypt it i used https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/
after decryption it was -l3arn_th3_r0p35
so this is our flag data now rewrite this in our picoCTF flag format and the final flag is 
picoCTF{l3arn_th3_r0p35}
