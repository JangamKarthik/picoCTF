description-
Files can always be changed in a secret way. Can you find the flag? cat.jpg
okay here I was confused the description is not enough to understand the question 
but we had a jpg to download and proceed so for doing that first what i did was downloadig the file.
to download it through the web shell i used the command wget and pasted the url of it
type- wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/7cf6a33f90deeeac5c73407a1bdc99b6/cat.jpg
now after downloading this image i opened it and looked for the flag it
i didn't find the flag in  the image so i thought of using the hints given
so i opened the first one it says Look at the details of the file
so there is something called as meta data which is known for providing the data for a given data like say i have a image i need its meta data
then i shall provide the image to a metadata extractor which will give me its corresponding data
then i found this metadata exctracor website on the web it was - https://www.metadata2go.com
here i uploaded the cat.png file and it gave me the metadata for the following 
there i saw the license it was a really long string of characters so I thought of decoding it 
so i used - https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/
then i pasted the license then i got my flag after decoding
the license was- cGljb0NURnt0aGVfbTN0YWRhdGFfMXNfbW9kaWZpZWR9
the flag was- picoCTF{the_m3tadata_1s_modified}
level up!
